// This happens when the HTML generated on the server doesn't match what is rendered on the client. 
// Here are a few common causes and solutions:

// Conditional Rendering: Ensure that any conditional rendering based on window or other client-specific 
// variables is handled correctly. For example, use useEffect for client-side only code:

// React.useEffect(() => {
//   // Client-side code here
// }, []);
// Dynamic Data: Avoid using dynamic values like Date.now() or Math.random() directly in your components.
//  Instead, fetch or calculate these values in useEffect or similar hooks.

// Locale-Specific Formatting: Ensure that any locale-specific formatting (like dates) is consistent between 
// server and client. You might need to format dates on the client side only.

// External Data: Make sure any external data is consistent between server and client. You can pass a snapshot
// of the data along with the HTML to ensure consistency.

// Invalid HTML Tag Nesting: Check for any invalid HTML tag nesting that might cause discrepancies.

// Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where the HTML of a webpage is generated 
// on the server and sent to the client. This is in contrast to Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where the HTML is generated in the browser using JavaScript.

// Benefits of SSR:

// Improved Performance: Since the HTML is generated on the server, the initial load time can be faster,
//  especially for users with slower internet connections.
// Better SEO: Search engines can crawl and index the fully rendered HTML, improving the site's search engine ranking.
// Enhanced User Experience: Users see the content faster, even if JavaScript is still loading.
// How SSR Works:

// Request: The client (browser) sends a request to the server.
// Server Processing: The server processes the request, generates the HTML, and sends it back to the client.
// Hydration: Once the HTML is loaded, React takes over and makes the page interactive by attaching event handlers.
